BizON is end user application, powered by the Dirigble platform, for designing application domains and scafolding full-stack applications to support them.
It is designed with simplicity but comprehensiveness in mind so people in different roles can takeover the design in different stages, or together.

Start from scratch or use an existing domain model and customize it to your case. BizON is ideal for domain model-dirven applications. Once you reach a milestone in your domain design, create a full stack application out of it at the cost of a single click. Then extend and customize it, building on its (micro)services or entity libraries.
